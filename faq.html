        <div class="questionAnswer firstQuestion">
          <div class="question" id="whatIsPopHealth">What is popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth is an open source reference implementation software service that automates the reporting of Meaningful Use quality measures. popHealth integrates with a healthcare provider’s electronic health record (EHR) system using continuity of care records.  popHealth streamlines the automated generation of summary quality measure reports on the provider’s patient population.</p>
          <p>Key to popHealth's value for providers and vendors interested in implementing summary quality reporting:
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to quickly view and report static quality measures based on established quality measures.</li>
              <li>Infrastructure to eventually remotely automate the addition of new quality measure reports, and export multiple modes of reporting output.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="objective">What is the objective of popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth is designed to simplify the reporting of summary quality measures, and streamline the exchange of summary quality data. Demonstration of Meaningful Use requires the reporting of quality measure data. This reference implementation open source software demonstrates how providers can rapidly produce and submit Meaningful Use clinical quality measures.  Further, popHealth provides EHR vendors with a reference implementation software package to guide the development of further Meaningful Use quality measures.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="users">Who are the intended users of popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth supports healthcare providers and EHR vendors by reporting clinical quality measures from electronic health record continuity of care files. Providers are empowered to better understand, and analyze the health of their patient population, and meet Meaningful Use reporting objectives, through reports of clinical quality measures. EHR vendors and healthcare providers are free to download, use, and integrate the popHealth software in their systems.
        </p>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="philosophy">What is the popHealth design philosophy?</div>
          <p>popHealth is designed for ease of deployment, use and integration with a healthcare provider's EHR system. The software has been designed to be permissive and extensible, with the ability to support various data standards for input and output. All popHealth software, and dependent libraries are available under an open source distribution license.</p>
          <p>popHealth demonstrates an alternative approach to population health analysis and reporting. It does this by performing analysis within a healthcare provider's infrastructure and producing a summary data for evaluation and submission. This option provides an alternative to existing models where providers must transport large quantities of data, which simplifies the reporting and review process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="vendor">Do I need to be a healthcare provider or EHR vendor to use popHealth?</div>
          <p>No. While a healthcare provider will have access to real patient records, and an EHR provider will have a much better understanding of the technical details of the data standards that are used for healthcare information technology systems, we have ensured that others can use popHealth. However, even novice technologists interested in learning more about healthcare quality measures will benefit from downloading and using popHealth. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="funding">Who is funding the popHealth project?</div>
          <p>The popHealth project is being funded by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="report">How can popHealth be used to report EHR quality measurement data?</div>
          <p>At its core, popHealth is a simple way of aggregating patients' healthcare data inside a provider's secure operational system. By providing software that can perform analysis and reporting from within a healthcare provider's infrastructure, popHealth demonstrates an alternative approach to population health analysis and reporting. It is an alternative to the existing, legacy model of centralized data collection and analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="meaningfuluse">Can popHealth be used to demonstrate Meaningful Use?</div>
          <p>The popHealth Meaningful Use Stage I measures are being developed and tested to assure accurate MU Clinical Quality Measure reports.  Collaboration with Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Measure specification stewards will assure that popHealth’s reports calculate as designed.  The “export report” function provides an easy-to-run method for providers to submit reports in the required technical format.</p>
          <p>Providers are encouraged to validate the accuracy of their Meaningful Use Clinical Quality Reports to allow for data entry or coding variation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="standards">What standards does popHealth use?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been designed to be permissive, and support numerous data and transport standards.  popHealth's first deployment uses the <a href="http://hitsp.org/ConstructSet_Details.aspx?&PrefixAlpha=4&PrefixNumeric=32">HITSP C32</a> and <a href="http://www.ccrstandard.com/">ASTM Continuity of Care Record (CCR)</a>standard for data input, and the Physician Quality Report Initiative (PQRI) registry XML for reporting output. popHealth is designed to be extensible, supporting multiple standards for both input and output into the future; <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/CDA-Release2-Unofficial.html" target="_external">CDA documents</a>, <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Product_CCD">HL7 CCD</a>, <a href="http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/E31_ConceptPaper.doc">ASTM CCR</a>, and the <a href="http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Quality_Reporting_Document_Architecture">HL7 QRDA</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="provideruse">What is basic Concept of Operations for use of popHealth by a provider?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been designed to operate within a provider’s infrastructure. This design decision has been made to address privacy and security concerns associated with access to information associated with individual patient records.</p>

        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="browsers">What web browsers can be used with popHealth?</div>
          <p>popHealth has been developed and tested for use in FireFox 3.0 and higher, Internet Explorer (IE) 7, and IE 8, as well as Safari 4. Support for other web browsers hasn't been tested, but the project will endeavor to support as many web browsers as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="languages">What programming languages does popHealth use?</div>
          <p>popHealth runs on the Ruby on Rails framework, and uses the MongoDB open source document database. Developing new software with popHealth, and/or adding new customized features will require non-trivial software development knowledge of the Ruby and Java programming languages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="questionAnswer">
          <div class="question" id="laika">How is popHealth related to project Laika?</div>
          <p>The vast majority of the software supporting popHealth runs atop of <a href="http://www.mitre.org" target="_external">the MITRE Corporation's</a> open source <a href="http://projectlaika.org" target="_external">Laika</a> project infrastructure.  All of the supporting Laika software and source code, is also freely available under an Apache 2.0 open source distribution license.</p>
